# odin-landing-page
With this project I expect to develop a deeper understanding on the css layout using flexbox. Starting from scratch but with an starting point to look at, and guide myself of how the page should look like. I don't expecting to be easy, but I have confidence that I will perform well. There are some concepts and ideas I still struggle with, like flex-basis, that I will look to apply.
